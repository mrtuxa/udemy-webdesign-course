            <h2 class="content">Linux Kernel to Rust</h2>

            <section id="content">
                <p>
                    AUSTIN, TEX. — Rust, the fast-growing systems programming <br />
                    language, may be merged into the Linux kernel next year, <br />
                    or “maybe the next release,” according to Linux creator Linus Torvalds.<br />
                    <br /><br />
                    The creator of Linux made the statement Tuesday during an on-stage <br />
                    interview at the Linux Foundation‘s Open Source Summit North America.<br />
                    <br /><br />
                    After his announcement drew enthusiastic applause from the summit <br />
                    audience at downtown Austin’s J.W. Marriott hotel, he cautioned, <br />
                    “Don’t get too excited. We know who you are.”<br />
                    <br /><br />
                    The Linux kernel project, he told interviewer Dirk Hohndel, chief <br />
                    open source officer at the Cardano Foundation, has grown more careful <br />
                    about how it makes changes, in light of how many users worldwide depend on it. <br />
                    <br /><br />
                    “We were more freewheeling 30 years ago,” he told Hohndel, an early <br />
                    Linux contributor. “It was more like the Wild West: Someone would <br />
                    send a patch and it would just get merged, and why not? <br />
                    But now we can’t afford to do that.”<br />
                    <br /><br />
                    Some attempts to incorporate new languages into the Linux kernel, <br />
                    Torvalds noted, haven’t succeeded: “We tried C++ 25 years ago. <br />
                    We tried it for two weeks. And then we stopped trying it.”<br />
                    <br /><br />
                    The caution, he said, is a cornerstone of the Linux project. <br />
                    “I tell my sub-maintainers and developers all the time, <br />
                    ‘You can do anything, but we can’t break people’s workloads.’ <br />
                    We can’t break what people do.”<br />
                    <br /><br />
                    He added, “If you upgrade the kernel, <br />
                    it should do what it’s supposed to. And if it doesn’t, <br />
                    you should scream at us. In the end, <br />
                    it’s really the users that matter.”<br />
                </p>
